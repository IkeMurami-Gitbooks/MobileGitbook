* App Transport Security exceptions shouldn’t be set on production environments.
* If you use third party networking libraries, verify the secure connection.
* For high risk applications, use certificate pinning.
* Always follow good mobile application development practices -> see our [Guidelines on mobile application security – iOS edition](https://www.securing.pl/en/guidelines-on-mobile-application-security-ios-edition/).
