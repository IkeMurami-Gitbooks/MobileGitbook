# Frameworks List

## Answer: Is there a multi-platform framework for developing iPhone / Android applications?

### Phonegap

`Phonegap` is a JavaScript/CSS/HTML based framework that targets the iPhone, Android, and the Blackberry. It (on the iPhone at least) can be bundled as a native app too. The UI layer for these apps typically is built in html/JavaScript and can be slower than a true native app.

### React Native

`React Native` enables you to build world-class application experiences on native platforms using a consistent developer experience based on JavaScript and React. The focus of React Native is on developer efficiency across all the platforms you care about â€” learn once, write anywhere. Facebook uses React Native in multiple production apps and will continue investing in React Native. The UI for React Native applications are native controls - so your UI is usually faster than a pure HTML/JavaScript approach for GUI management.

### MonoGame

`MonoGame` is an open source implementation of the Microsoft XNA 4.x Framework. It makes it easy for XNA developers to create cross-platform games with extremely high code reuse. It currently supports iOS, Android, Windows (both OpenGL and DirectX), Mac OS X, Linux, Windows 8 Store, Windows Phone 8, PlayStation Mobile, and the OUYA console.

### Adobe Flash

`Adobe Flash` And believe it or not, Adobe Flash can publish native binaries to ios, android, desktop and of course the web. The performance is reasonable, but not incredible. If you had a Flash game, you may be able to take it to mobile very easily. And this does not require any plugins of any sort. It actually creates a native standalone binary that runs on each platform.
